# Planned or Possible Improvements

## Straightforward

- Fix build when selecting. Currently every build expands the selected lines by one.

## Hard
- Remote Desktop: Make a python process that opens Stata and constantly polls a dropbox/gdrive/pushbullet file for what to run (which is saved when ctrl+b is run on the client computer)
